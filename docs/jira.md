This integration will create an issue in JIRA when crash reports or in-application feedback is submitted.

The *server url* must include the full url (e.g, https://appblade.atlassian.net)

Your user name and password will be needed until we sort out how we are going to handle OAuth client secrets for a decentralized system like JIRA.
